    <h3>4. Differentiate between JVM, JRE, and JDK</h3>

    <p><strong>JDK</strong> provides the environment to develop and execute the java program.JDK contains two parts.</p>
    <p>One part contains javac, which convert source code into byte code. Second part is JRE which contains utilities like java which help in running the code</p>
    <p><strong>JRE</strong> provides the libraries, The JVM and other components to run only java byte code.</p>
    <p><strong>JVM</strong> is a software. It provides runtime environment in which java bytecode can be executed.</p>

    <h3>7. What Is the Difference Between Overloading and Overriding?</h3>

    <p>In method overloading the methods name are same but types of argument or no. of arguments are different.Return type of mehod does not play any role in method overloading.</p>

    <p>In method overriding method of subclass has the same ame and no. of argments or types of arguments are same as a method.Both signature and return must be the same as super class.</p>
